#  Solar Car Race Strategy Public Archive

This is a public archive of my research project on the modelling and strategy 
optimisation of solar racing. Some info have been removed but this should give 
you somewhere to start if you happen to be interested in strategy development 
for solar racing. This work was focused on developing strategy for the World Solar 
Challenge, and if you happen to race in ASC or ESC, then it will be a slightly 
different, but equally interesting optimsation problem. 

Please do reference my work if you do happen to find it useful but more 
importantly share what you have done with me, I'm interested to hear from you!
