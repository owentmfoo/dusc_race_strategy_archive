	abstract = {In circuit motorsport, race strategy helps to ﬁnish the race in the best possible position by optimally determining the pit stops. Depending on the racing series, pit stops are needed to replace worn-out tires, refuel the car, change drivers, or repair the car. Assuming a race without opponents and considering only tire degradation, the optimal race strategy can be determined by solving a quadratic optimization problem, as shown in the paper. In high-class motorsport, however, this simpliﬁed approach is not sufﬁcient. There, comprehensive race simulations are used to evaluate the outcome of different strategic options. The published race simulations require the user to specify the expected strategies of all race participants manually. In such simulations, it is therefore desirable to automate the strategy decisions, for better handling and greater realism. It is against this background that we present a virtual strategy engineer (VSE) based on two artiﬁcial neural networks. Since our research is focused on the Formula 1 racing series, the VSE decides whether a driver should make a pit stop and which tire compound to ﬁt. Its training is based on timing data of the six seasons from 2014 to 2019. The results show that the VSE makes reasonable decisions and reacts to the particular race situation. The integration of the VSE into a race simulation is presented, and the effects are analyzed in an example race.},

This strategy consists of ﬁnding the racing line and the speed proﬁle that minimizes the lap time with a given amount of energy. The problem is formulated in proper form for a commercial nonlinear optimization software program. The track is modeled into segments identiﬁed by their spatial coordinates on its own surface. The speed-distance behavior of the vehicle is linearized at each segment. The constraints set by the brushless DC motor, battery, and circuit are formulated accordingly. This is the motor type widely used in electric cars. The solver produces both the positions of the car on the track and entry speeds into the segments, which minimizes the lap time for the given amount of the solar power and battery reserve. The positions of the car describe the best racing line. Formulation of the constraints allows extracting the motor current proﬁle from the speed proﬁle, which comprises the set of control actions. These proﬁles help the human driver identify where and how much to accelerate along the track for the desired performance of the car. The algorithm presented here can also serve as a tool to assess the performance of an electric car at diﬀerent road conditions, thus helping to choose the best settings of the motor and the car.},

	abstract = {In motorsports, lap time simulation (LTS) is used by race engineers to evaluate the effects of setup changes on lap time and energy consumption. Many of the LTS published to date are no longer able to meet today’s requirements because more and more racing series are introducing hybrid systems to improve powertrain efﬁciency. In addition, some racing series have purely electric powertrains. As a result, new types of LTS are needed that can represent the current state of technology. In addition to various powertrain types and topologies, this also includes the drag reduction system as well as the simulation of energy management strategies that control the distribution of energy within the hybrid system. For use as a co-simulation together with a race simulation, yellow ﬂags and pit lanes should also be modeled. This paper presents an LTS that covers these aspects and, thanks to an improved quasi-steady-state solver, delivers accurate results within a short computing time. Particular emphasis was placed on easy parametrization, based on publicly available data. Exemplary results are shown for Formula 1 and Formula E cars on different racetracks. Three different energy management strategies are compared with regard to the most efﬁcient use of the available energy.},

	abstract = {The “World Solar Challenge” is a biannual 
event in which teams race 3021km from the north to the 
south of Australia. Cars are exclusively solar-powered, save 
for one full charge of the car’s battery before the race; as 
such, the event drives innovation in maximizing power 
collection, and improving efficiency of power management.
Due to fluctuating variables such as sunlight and road
incline, minimising journey time relies on racing strategy. 
The Durham University Solar Car (DUSC) strategy is tested 
in computer simulations of the race. The present work 
aimed to improve simulations’ accuracy, by (i) improving
input data accuracy, and (ii) considering new factors 
completely (shading; detailed solar array geometry; and 
electronics). The latter task, as well as improving accuracy, 
was used to find optimal layout of a 4m2 array for the car, 
2m2
smaller than the DUSC’s previous array size. This 
change was driven by new rules for the 2017 WSC, which
reduced the maximum solar array size to 4m2. The optimal
number and locations of bypass diodes and maximum 
power point trackers (MPPTs) were also found.
Using the 4m2 array layout, the optimal number of bypass 
diodes was 23, and MPPTs was 7. Optimal average velocity 
with a constant target velocity strategy was found to be 
58.9km/h. With a variable target velocity strategy, this 
became 61.4km/h},

	abstract = {In this work, optimal control theory is applied to minimum lap time simulation of a GP2 car, using a multibody car model with enhanced load transfer dynamics. The mathematical multibody model is formulated with use of the symbolic algebra software MBSymba and it comprises 14 degrees of freedom, including full chassis motion, suspension travels and wheel spins. The kinematics of the suspension is exhaustively analysed and the impact of tyre longitudinal and lateral forces in determining vehicle trim is demonstrated. An indirect optimal control method is then used to solve the minimum lap time problem. Simulation outcomes are compared with experimental data acquired during a qualifying lap at Montmeló circuit (Barcelona) in the 2012 GP2 season. Results demonstrate the reliability of the model, suggesting it can be used to optimise car settings (such as gearing and aerodynamic setup) before executing track tests.},

	abstract = {Lap-time simulation is an important computational tool for many motor racing teams, but the assumption of ideal operating conditions and a ‘perfect’ racing driver is usually made. The aim of this paper is to extend lap-time simulation to include robustness to disturbances on the vehicle and robustness to mistakes by the driver. A previously developed receding-horizon model predictive control with a convex optimisation method for lap-time simulation is extended with a tube-based technique for robust model predictive control. A linear quadratic regulator compensatory controller maintains the vehicle close to the nominal vehicle path and speed trajectories in the presence of disturbances to the vehicle. An ensemble of disturbed trajectories defines a tube of trajectories, which is then used to modify the nominal vehicle path so that the track boundary constraints are satisfied in the presence of the disturbances. The lap time versus r.m.s. steering velocity curves for two different vehicle models demonstrate the expected trade-off: a decrease in the activity of the compensatory steering control increases the tube width, which leads to a longer lap time. The technique has application to designing and setting up cars to perform well in the presence of disturbances.},

	abstract = {Energy management has been one of the most important parts in electric race strategies since the Fe´de´ration Internationale de l’Automobile Formula-E championships were launched in 2014. Since that time, a number of unfavorable race ﬁnishes have been witnessed due to poor energy management. Previous researches have been focused on managing the power ﬂow between different energy sources or different energy consumers based on a ﬁxed cycle. However, there is no published work in the literature about energy management of a full electric racing car on repeated course but with changeable settings and driving styles. Different from traditional energy management problems, the electric race strategy is more of a multistage decision-making problem which has a very large scale. Meanwhile, this is a time-critical task in motorsport where fast prediction tools are needed and decisions have to be made in seconds to beneﬁt the ﬁnal outcome of the race. In this study, the use of artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) and tree search techniques is investigated as an approach to solve such a large-scale problem. ANN prediction models are developed to replace the traditional lap time simulation as a much faster performance prediction tool. Implementation of Monte Carlo tree search based on the proposed ANN fast prediction models has provided decent capability to generate decision-making solution for both pre-race planning and in-race reaction to unexpected scenarios.},

However accurate measurements are not a common commodity, especially over longer time spans. To circumvent the lack of ground based measurements, models can be applied to estimate solar irradiance components. A fundamental component is clear sky irradiance. In particular, clear sky irradiance is used as the normalization function in models that convert meteorological satellite images into irradiance, or in models that decompose global irradiance into diﬀuse/direct fraction. It is therefore important to evaluate and validate clear sky irradiance models.},

	abstract = {Applying an optimal race strategy is a decisive factor in achieving the best possible result in a motorsport race. This mainly implies timing the pit stops perfectly and choosing the optimal tire compounds. Strategy engineers use race simulations to assess the effects of different strategic decisions (e.g., early vs. late pit stop) on the race result before and during a race. However, in reality, races rarely run as planned and are often decided by random events, for example, accidents that cause safety car phases. Besides, the course of a race is affected by many smaller probabilistic influences, for example, variability in the lap times. Consequently, these events and influences should be modeled within the race simulation if real races are to be simulated, and a robust race strategy is to be determined. Therefore, this paper presents how state of the art and new approaches can be combined to modeling the most important probabilistic influences on motorsport races—accidents and failures, full course yellow and safety car phases, the drivers’ starting performance, and variability in lap times and pit stop durations. The modeling is done using customized probability distributions as well as a novel “ghost” car approach, which allows the realistic consideration of the effect of safety cars within the race simulation. The interaction of all influences is evaluated based on the Monte Carlo method. The results demonstrate the validity of the models and show how Monte Carlo simulation enables assessing the robustness of race strategies. Knowing the robustness improves the basis for a reasonable determination of race strategies by strategy engineers.},

Soft boundary violation penalties in reward shaping, significantly improves the performance of DDPG and makes it capable of generating faster race finishing solutions.
