##Obtaining the data
* [Met Office WoW](https://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/) need to log into an accout (google or facebook will do) to download observation data. Potential to use API but request for an API key never got approved.
* [Aus BoM](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/oneminsolar/about-IDCJAC0022.shtml) DBSW have login.
* [ERA5-Land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview) quite nice and extensive database, require registration but not difficult to use.
* [Solcast](https://solcast.com/) Either purchase data or sign up for academic license, they do sponsor teams including Western Sydney and Illini.
